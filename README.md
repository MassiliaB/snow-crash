## Getting Started

### VM Setup - VirtualBox Network Configuration

We recommend setting up a VirtualBox Host-Only network.

- Select "Host-Only Network" in VirtualBox network settings.
- This configuration provides a private network between the host and the VM.

If there is no Host-Only Network configured:

- Go to "Tools" in VirtualBox and click on "Network".
- Select "Host-Only Network" and create a new one if none exists.
- Open the Networking section for your virtual machine and select "Host-only Network".
- Choose the host-only network from the drop-down list, preferably the one you just created.

### SSH Access

To access the VM via SSH 

```bash
ssh -p 4242 levelXX@<ip>
```
